Create infra using terraform code

## Steps to Deploy
Initialize the Project:
    terraform init

Plan the Deployment:
    terraform plan
Apply the Deployment:
    terraform apply


Note: This setup will create the necessary AWS resources with Terraform, ensuring that the EFS volume is mounted on the EC2 instance, the Elastic IP is assigned, and the outputs you requested are displayed after running terraform apply.

Thanks!!
